# genomic-evaluation-platform
Personalized genomics platform that provides users with information about their family history, genetic conditions and health risks based on their DNA sequences.

## Running application

To run this application, you must:

1. Clone this repository
2. Create both `.env` files from `/src/.env.sample` and `/src/dbs/postgres/.env.sample` in the same directories

Then you can start it in two modes â€” development or production.

### Development mode 

To run the application in development mode with Docker Compose or NPM, execute:
  - `$ docker compose --profile dev up`
  - `$ npm install && npm run dev`

This mode uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon), which has hot-reloading mecanism.

### Production mode

To run the application in production mode with Docker Compose or NPM, execute:
  - `$ docker compose --profile prod up`
  - `$ npm ci --omit=dev && npm start`

**NOTE:** Both development and production modes, with NPM, require you pass the environment variables of `/src/env` to NodeJS. Docker Compose does that automatically.

## TO-DOs:

- Add automated tests package
- Add other NoSQL database containers and networks (and theirs respective packages, configs and environment variables)
- Create schema to relational model of database
- Create schemas to NoSQL models of databases
- Create functions and procedures that will fit application into requirements
